## Purpose

The Food Tracker is a command line application built using Java that allows users to track their body metrics and daily food consumption. It was created as a way to maintain a healthy lifestyle and as a showcase of the knowledge gained through completing the Java MOOC program offered by the University of Helsinki.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Food Tracker was to create a tool that could be used on a daily basis to track body metrics and food intake. This project was an opportunity to build something that could be used personally to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to demonstrate the skills and knowledge gained through completing a Java MOOC program while still being a full-time student in the Biology program at UBC.

## Tech Stack

The Food Tracker was built using the following technology:

-   Java: A programming language used for creating a wide range of applications, including command line applications such as the Food Tracker.

## Features

The Food Tracker includes the following features:

-   Multiple user support: The Food Tracker allows for multiple users to track their body metrics and food intake.
-   CRUD functionality: The Food Tracker includes basic create, read, update, and delete functionality for body metrics and daily food consumption.
-   Tracking of body metrics: Users can track their height, weight, and other body metrics using the Food Tracker.
-   Tracking of daily food consumption: Users can track the calories, fat, carbs, and protein intake of their daily food consumption using the Food Tracker.

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building the Food Tracker was the challenge of ensuring that the application is functional and performs the necessary operations correctly. This involved testing and debugging the code to ensure that the application works as expected. I didn't know about unit tests at the time of building this application therefore all of the testing was conducted manually. This made it very easy for bugs to go undetected until some random point during runtime. 

## Accomplishments

By building the Food Tracker, I achieved a number of accomplishments, including:

-   Demonstrating the skills and knowledge gained through completing a Java MOOC program
-   Creating a functional command line application that can be used on a daily basis to track body metrics and food intake
-   Building a tool that can be used to maintain a healthy lifestyle


## Future Changes

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Food Tracker in the future. Some potential improvements could include:

-   Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly and visually appealing
-   Implementing a feature to track daily exercise and activity levels
-   Integrating with external APIs to provide more comprehensive nutrition and exercise recommendations
-   Adding support for tracking additional body metrics and food intake data.
